            <p class="about-body"><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't
            even appreciate any of it because there was too much. </p>
            <p class="about-body">
                Things were terrible. I had a
                job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-subtitle">How I turned things around</h3>
            <p class="about-body">
                <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I
                literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller
                apartment, and I quit my job. 
            </p>
            <p class="about-body">
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place,
                I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p class="about-body">
                Now that I'm living a simple life,
                things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p class="about-body">
                    With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>,
                    and how
                    others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
